# Weather-Dashboard
This week we had to make a Weather Dashboard that could give the weather for any city that you type in and create a history for 
the searched cities below. We had to make it give the weather for that current time and then also display a 5 forecast. We had to display
the Temperature, Humidity, Windspeed and the UV Index. The search history had to be saved to local storage.

The trouble I had with this assignment came with the API and just trying to get it to call. Through countless trial and error I finally found
the correct api code. 

Another issue I had and ran out of time unfortunately to figure out but I cant for some reason get the city Tampa Bay to work but I have come to
learn that the city isnt actually named TAMPA BAY AND JUST TAMPA!!! TIL. Hah.
